There are mood alterations associated with the above drugs as relevant and in keeping with a vanilla theme as best as possible, whilst still allowing for refinement.

Research projects associated and bulk recipes provided.

Mod option to vary the base research costs by a percentage level.

Bulk recipes for the vanilla drugs: Pekoe tea, flake, yayo, go-juice, wake-up  and smokeleaf joints have been added.
